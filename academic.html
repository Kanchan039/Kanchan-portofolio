            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <p>
                My primary interest lies in <strong>mathematical analysis</strong>, with a focus on rigorous proof techniques and conceptual clarity.
                I have a strong liking for <strong>topology</strong> and its abstract mathematical thinking, developed during my M.Sc. at IIT Kanpur.
                My project experience includes <strong>homology</strong> in algebraic topology and a reading project in <strong>multivariable calculus</strong>, which strengthened my analytical skills and geometric intuition.
                At this stage, I am dedicated to building a strong foundation in analysis and topology and developing as a proof-oriented thinker, while remaining open to discovering new directions in mathematics.
            </p>

            <h2>Major Projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Conceptual Foundations in Multivariate Calculus</strong> — Reading project focusing on strengthening conceptual clarity, geometric intuition, and rigorous proofs, under the supervision of <strong>Prof. Sivaguru R., TIFR CAM, Bangalore</strong> (Jun 2025–Aug 2025).</li>
                <li><strong>Equivalence of Simplicial and Singular Homology in Delta Complex</strong> — Studied algebraic invariants of topological spaces, established the equivalence of simplicial and singular homology, and applied the theory to results like the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem.
