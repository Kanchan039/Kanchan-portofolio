             <h2>Experience</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>,<strong>Teaching Assistant-Lodha Genius Programme</strong>, at Ashoka UNiversity, Sonipat, Haryana - May 2025-June 2025</li>
                <li> <strong>Summer Research Fellowship Programme</strong>, funded by Council of Science and Technology, Uttar Pradesh - June 2025-August 2025</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <p> My primary interest lies in mathematical analysis, particularly in areas that emphasize rigorous proof techniques and conceptual clarity. I have especially enjoyed working with real analysis and several variable calculus, and I find deep satisfaction in understanding and constructing precise mathematical arguments. In my MSc journey at IIT Kanpur, I developed a strong liking for topology, which I studied in my second semester. This exposure sparked my interest in abstract mathematical thinking. During the summer of 2025, I pursued two projects — one based on <strong>homology</strong>, which gave me a preliminary glimpse into algebraic topology, and another, a reading project in ,<strong>multivariable calculus</strong>strong>, which strengthened my analytical skills and geometric intuition. At this stage, I am eager to further explore analysis, deepen my understanding of topology, and continue developing as a proof-oriented thinker. While I remain open to discovering new directions in the future, my current focus is on building a strong foundation in analysis and exploring how mathematical ideas are developed and justified through precise logical reasoning. </p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Equivalence of Simplicial and Singular Homology in &Delta;-Complex</strong> — Developed an elementary understanding in Algebraic Topology. In this project I have learned what is homology, why we consider it, and then i have read different type of homology in different complex structures, with the application. It was a month long project under the supervision of <strong>Dr. Mohit Upmanyu, (Post-Doc Fellow, Chennai Mathematical Institute, Chennai)</strong> at Ashoka University, Haryana.</li>
                <li><strong>Conceptual Foundation of Multivariate Calculus</strong> — It was a two month long reading project carried out under the supervision of Prof. Sivaguru R. at ,<strong>Tata Institute of Fundamental Research CAM, Bangalore</strong>. During this time, I have developed a strong understanding for the obious things in mathematics, that I always assume that to be true. I have developed a geometric intution, which is very useful for further research, basically, I have mastered the tools that are useful in research in any topic in mathematics. </li>
