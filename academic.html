            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <p>My primary interest lies in **mathematical analysis**, with a focus on rigorous proof techniques and conceptual clarity. [cite_start]I have a strong liking for **topology** and its abstract mathematical thinking, developed during my M.Sc. at IIT Kanpur[cite: 127]. [cite_start]My project experience includes **homology** in algebraic topology and a reading project in **multivariable calculus**, which strengthened my analytical skills and geometric intuition[cite: 44, 23]. [cite_start]At this stage, I am dedicated to building a strong foundation in analysis and topology and developing as a proof-oriented thinker, while remaining open to discovering new directions in mathematics[cite: 23, 37, 42].</p>

            <h2>Major Projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Conceptual Foundations in Multivariate Calculus</strong> — Reading project focusing on strengthening conceptual clarity, geometric intuition, and rigorous proofs, under the supervision of **Prof. [cite_start]Sivaguru R., TIFR CAM, Bangalore** (Jun 2025–Aug 2025)[cite: 23, 24, 25, 26, 37, 41].</li>
                [cite_start]<li><strong>Equivalence of Simplicial and Singular Homology in Delta Complex</strong> — Studied algebraic invariants of topological spaces, established the equivalence of simplicial and singular homology, and applied the theory to results like the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem[cite: 44, 46, 48, 50]. Project was under the supervision of **Dr. Mohit Upmanyu (Post Doc at CMI)** at Ashoka University, Haryana.</li>
